        does not test, screen, control, endorse, or accept responsibility for any such
        third-party Content or services (including, without limitation, errors or

        such Content or services, including, without limitation, such third party's
        PRIVACY_POLICY policies, use of personal information, delivery of and payment for
        goods and services, and any other terms associated with such dealings, are

        Autodesk or third parties) may require assent to separate terms and/or payment
        of additional fees.</p>

        these Terms under Section 10.2 (Effect of Termination), Autodesk reserves the
        right to delete inactive accounts or purge related Content (and all backups
        thereof), without further notice and Autodesk Parties shall have no
        responsibility or liability for deletion or any failure to store Your Content.
        Autodesk may remove any Content that is posted to the Service without notice if

        terminated at any time by Autodesk, with or without cause, effective upon
        notice of termination; and (ii) if no expiration date or end of term is
        identified in the Entitlements, and neither of the events described in (b), (c)
        or (d) above has first occurred, then these Terms shall terminate on the first
        anniversary of the Effective Date.&nbsp; Without limitation of anything in this
        paragraph, for all Service Offerings accessed as part of Subscription, these
        Terms and Your access to the Services will terminate when Your Subscription (and
        the Subscription Program Terms applicable to Your Subscription) terminates or
        expires.&nbsp;</p>

        the Service.&nbsp; Termination of these Terms does not affect, or give You any
        right to terminate, any Additional Agreement.&nbsp; Sections&nbsp;1.4, 1.5, 2,
        3.1 (first sentence), 3.2 through 9 and 10.2 through 12 will survive
        termination of these Terms for any reason.&nbsp; It is Your responsibility to
        retain copies of Your Content.&nbsp; Upon termination Autodesk
        shall have the right to immediately delete, without notice, Your Content, if
